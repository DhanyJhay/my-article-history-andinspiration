Pets And Their Relationship With Humans

Keeping pets is the best thing for a fellow animal lover. Like a cute cat who is always happy to play and bother us to ask for company. Like a dog who always wants to be played with, running around when a toy has been thrown. We as humans should maintain the balance of this life so that feelings of love can be established between fellow creatures.

We need to note that there are so many abandoned and neglected animals everywhere. Whether it's on the streets, in residential areas and seeing their condition, there are very concerning. Why do I say concern, because the condition of these animals is not maintained at all. For example, a cat that gives birth to its cubs and some are sick from hunger, because their mother doesn't take care of them. Their condition is thin, looking for food here and there. There is also like a dog that we always think of these animals as wild. We need to give them a proper place, proper food. So that these animals can stay and can rest.

It is very sad to see such a condition. I sometimes like sad when cats cry when they see me, they want to ask for food. How happy I was when I shared with that cat. Even if it's just a piece of fish that I eat or a small bowl of milk that I brew to drink. This is the pleasure I feel, when I share my feelings with the cat. Although I don't think of him as my pet. But the cat is always there to rest in front of my house.

Likewise with other animals, as I said earlier. There are dogs, birds, fish, turtles and others. For that, start from now on to be someone who really cares and loves these animals. Because they (animals), also need a sincere love from every human being. Whether it's by keeping it or just feeding it and drinking it, when we pass each other on the road or somewhere.

Let's start early and instill in our hearts a great sense of empathy and concern for these animals. Don't wait for us to be old by time but make our time very valuable and valuable in the time we live. From us small to big, to love animals like a part of our family.

Hopefully what I say can be useful and an inspiration for all. thank you
